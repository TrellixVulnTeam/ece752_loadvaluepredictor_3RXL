/**
 * @defgroup   CONSTANT_VERIFICATION_UNIT constant verification unit
 *
 * @brief      This file the implements class of the constant verification unit
 * 			   for a load value predictor.
 * 			   The constant verification unit has the following functions:                     
 * 			   - Keep track of load addresses which have been deemed "constant"
 * 			   by the LCT
 * 			   - Monitor all committed stores and invalidate a constant load 
 * 			   address if a store that is being committed has the same address
 * 			   as the constant load
 * 			   - Compare a load value for address that had been deemed 
 * 			   "predictable" by the LCT with the actual load value retrieved 
 * 			   from memory
 * 			   - Provide feedback to the LCT for all predictable loads
 * 			   - Possible implementation of this class could also include a 
 * 			   mechanism to pass load values from the commit stage back to the
 * 			   LVPT (Since this will be needed if an instruction is to be 
 * 			   promoted from unpredictable to predictable and so on.)
